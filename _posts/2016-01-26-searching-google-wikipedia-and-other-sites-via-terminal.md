During work I get a lot of stuff done via command line tasks or scripts. So why not search for stuff via cli because it is open anyway? Today I came across s, a project by [Josh Ellithorpe][je]. It's a little tool, written in go which is really easy to use: `s -p wikipedia <searchterm>` Using it without the `p` flag searches using Google by default. The following search engines/sites are currently integrated:

* amazon
* bing
* digg
* dockerhub
* duckduckgo
* github
* google
* pinterest
* reddit
* soundcloud
* stackoverflow
* twitter
* wikipedia
* yahoo
