Yeah, I switched to wordpress a while ago, I know. But I barely use all the features of wordpress and the overhead therefor is a lot. So I extracted all my posts from the last months and put them into a neat little, jekyll build, static site. Hope you guys enjoy it. If you have any questions, just drop me a mail or post a comment down below.
