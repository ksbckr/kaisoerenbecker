After some time of not using this domain, I decided to put up a little blog here. I’m just writing about some daily stuff I come across at work and in my spare time. Hopefully I will keep up writing posts now and then. After previously using Phile CMS for a while, I’m now back to WordPress.  
Keep checking back for more posts.
