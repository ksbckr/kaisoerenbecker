For some tasks it can be usefull to have a short howto for others to show. One of the best ways to explain something to someone is a screencast. Since there are restrictions on many websites/forums with uploading content like videos, image files are usually supported by any site.

When I was searching for a tool that supports saving screencasts as gif, I found [LICEcap][lc]. LICEcap is released as GPL free software and can be downloaded for OS X and Windows.

The interface is quite simple and only allows you to resize the capturing frame and set the frame rate:

Performance is really good and the output can be viewed without any problems. The tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and nothing more. I captured the obove screen for a few seconds, just to show you the output:
