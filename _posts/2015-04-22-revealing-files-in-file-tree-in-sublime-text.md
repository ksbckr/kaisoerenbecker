As I mentioned before, Iâ€™m using Sublime Text 3 as my main editor/IDE.
When searching through bigger projects with a lot of subfolders it is always nice to know where you are.
Sublime has the feature to highlight the current file inside the file tree in your sidebar.
For easier access you can put a shortcut into your user preferences:  
`{ "keys": ["super+shift+r"], "command": "reveal_in_side_bar"}`
