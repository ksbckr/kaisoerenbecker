For the last few years I was using macports as my favorite tool for using unix apps on OS X. 
With the years I installed a lot of stuff I barely used, so my point was to start from scratch with the things I need.
When trying out things like node js, I often had problems with finding the right packages and macports wasn't helpfull most of the time. 
So I switched over to homebrew, starting with a minimalistic list of packages, like postgres, htop and a few others.
I will keep you updated how things work out and if there is any trouble during OS updates or things like that.
